# leet-code-practice
I start my learning and working path as a junior network engineer, so I'm have no idea on data structure and algorithm.
Besides, learning theory is so boring without practicing. So I created this repo to solve the problem in leetcode with Golang.


Everyday/week, try to discuss and catch up with my friend.
