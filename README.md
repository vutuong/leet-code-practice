# leet-code-practice
I start my learning and working path as a junior network engineer, so I have no idea on data structure and algorithms.
Because learning theory is so boring without practicing, I created this repo to practise/solve the problem in leetcode with Golang.


Everyday/week, try to discuss and catch up with my friend.
